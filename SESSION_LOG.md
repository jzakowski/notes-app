### 🔧 Technical Implementation

**Category Filter Flow:**
1. User selects category from dropdown in sidebar
2. onChange handler navigates to /notes?category={categoryId}
3. Pages read filterCategoryId from useSearchParams()
4. Filter passed to NotesSidebar component
5. Sidebar filters notes by category
6. API receives categoryId query parameter
7. Prisma filters notes by categoryId

**URL Persistence:**
- Filter state stored in URL query params
- Survives page refreshes
- Works across all views
- Easy to share filtered views
