## Session 13 - [2026-01-07] - CODING AGENT

**Feature Implemented:**
- Feature #24: Note Share
- Implementation: Complete ✅
- Verification: API tested with curl, manual guide created

**Changes Made:**
- Created `src/app/api/notes/[id]/share/route.ts` - API endpoints for share functionality
- Created `src/app/share/[token]/page.tsx` - Public share page (view-only)
- Created `src/components/ShareModal.tsx` - Share modal UI component
- Modified `src/app/notes/[id]/page.tsx` - Added Share button and integration
- Created manual verification guide and test script

**Implementation Details:**
1. **Share Token Generation**: Uses crypto.randomBytes(32) for 256-bit security
2. **Public Share Page**: Clean, professional layout at /share/[token]
3. **Share Modal**: Generate link, copy to clipboard, revoke access
4. **Security**: Share links are unguessable, view-only access
5. **Database**: Uses existing isShared and shareToken fields

**Issues Found & Fixed:**
- None - implementation was straightforward using existing database schema

**Tests Passing:** 12/27 (previous: 11/27)

**Next Steps:**
